# You Have Completed the Prep!

Thank you for sticking with it! We're excited for you to start.

## Next Steps

You’ve passed your Prep Post Assessment - great work! Remember, you also need to complete your paperwork and get financially cleared in order to begin the program. Please contact <onboarding@flatironschool.com> if you're uncertain about start dates or anything else related to getting started.

In the meantime, we highly recommend that you work through the following content on Environment Set-Up as that will get you ready to hit the ground running on Day 1.

Once you have finished the topics above, below are supplemental resources that you can explore if you have additional time or could use some more practice before your first day.

## Supplemental Resources

You are not required to utilize any of these resources, and in general if you have limited time we recommend reviewing the course you’ve just completed and material above rather than additional readings or practice.

### Python

- **Python Essentials and Python Loops and Functions**: The free [Python course on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) covers a lot of the same material we covered in the Python part of the prep, if you want additional practice
 - **Data Visualization**: The Matplotlib website has a useful [tutorials page](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/tutorials/index.html), and Kaggle offers a free [data visualization course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) that gets into more depth than what we cover
 - **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation that we used in some brief examples in the prep but didn't introduce in depth. We'll be using it a lot in the program, so you might want to look at the [user guide on the pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) or Kaggle's free [pandas course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

### Statistics

 - **Overview**: This [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-basic-statistics-concepts-data-scientists-need-to-know-2c96740377ae) has a good introduction to the statistics concepts you'll need to know as a data scientist
 - **Probability**: Brilliant offers free [intro to probability lessons](https://brilliant.org/courses/probability/)
 - **Statistics**: If you're interested in working through a complete free statistics course, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) offers one that we recommend

The topics below were not introduced in the Prep and will be covered in the main course, but some students prefer to study in advance if they have not been exposed to these topics previously.

### Linear Algebra

 - **Overview**: This [blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/comprehensive-guide-to-linear-algebra/) has a good introduction to the linear algebra concepts you'll need to know as a data scientist
 - **The Essence of Linear Algebra**: This [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) from 3Blue1Brown has great visual explanations of the geometric concepts behind linear algebra

### Calculus

 - **Introduction**: Brilliant offers free [multivariable calculus lessons](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)
 - **The Essence of Calculus**: Similar to the linear algebra playlist linked above, this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) from 3Blue1Brown shows the geometric intuition behind calculus concepts
 - **Calculus**: If you're interested in working through a complete free calculus course, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) offers one that we recommend

### Command Line / Terminal

 - **Command Line Course**: OpenClassrooms offers a free [short course on the command line](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/4614926-learn-the-command-line-in-terminal) that is designed for beginners
 - **Command Line Game**: If you would rather learn by playing a game, this [terminal game from MIT](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) is a good choice

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

 - **SQL Course**: Both [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/2071486-retrieve-data-using-sql) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) offer intro to SQL courses

## Thank You!

We hope you have enjoyed your first experience with the technical topics and curriculum tools we use at Flatiron School. We're excited to see you on your first day!
