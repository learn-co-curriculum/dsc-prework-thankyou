# You Have Completed the Prework!

Thank you for sticking with it! We're excited for you to start.

## Next Steps

We do not expect you to complete any more preparation work before starting the main Data Science program. Please contact your Admissions representative if you're uncertain about start dates or anything else related to getting started.

## Supplemental Resources

If you have additional time or feel that you need additional practice or preparation before the Data Science program starts, we have collected links to some optional supplemental third-party resources below. ***You are not required to utilize any of these resources, and in general if you have limited time we recommend reviewing the provided prework rather than additional readings or practice.***

### Python

 - **Python Essentials and Python Loops and Functions**: The free [Python course on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) covers a lot of the same material we covered in the Python part of the prework, if you want additional practice
 - **Data Visualization**: The Matplotlib website has a useful [tutorials page](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/tutorials/index.html), and Kaggle offers a free [data visualization course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) that gets into more depth than what we cover
 - **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation that we used in some brief examples in the prework but didn't introduce in depth. We'll be using it a lot in the program, so you might want to look at the [user guide on the pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) or Kaggle's free [pandas course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

### Statistics

 - **Overview**: This [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-basic-statistics-concepts-data-scientists-need-to-know-2c96740377ae) has a good introduction to the statistics concepts you'll need to know as a data scientist
 - **Probability**: Brilliant offers free [intro to probability lessons](https://brilliant.org/courses/probability/)
 - **Statistics**: If you're interested in working through a complete free statistics course, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) offers one that we recommend

### Linear Algebra

This topic was not introduced in the prework and will be covered in the main course, but some students prefer to study in advance if they have not been exposed to it previously.

 - **Overview**: This [blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/comprehensive-guide-to-linear-algebra/) has a good introduction to the linear algebra concepts you'll need to know as a data scientist
 - **The Essence of Linear Algebra**: This [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) from 3Blue1Brown has great visual explanations of the geometric concepts behind linear algebra

### Calculus

 - **Introduction**: Brilliant offers free [multivariable calculus lessons](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)
 - **The Essence of Calculus**: Similar to the linear algebra playlist linked above, this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) from 3Blue1Brown shows the geometric intuition behind calculus concepts
 - **Calculus**: If you're interested in working through a complete free calculus course, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) offers one that we recommend

### Command Line / Terminal

This topic was not introduced in the prework and will be covered in the main course, but some students prefer to study in advance if they have not been exposed to it previously.

 - **Command Line Course**: OpenClassrooms offers a free [short course on the command line](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/4614926-learn-the-command-line-in-terminal) that is designed for beginners
 - **Command Line Game**: If you would rather learn by playing a game, this [terminal game from MIT](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) is a good choice

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

This topic was not introduced in the prework and will be covered in the main course, but some students prefer to study in advance if they have not been exposed to it previously.

 - **SQL Course**: Both [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/2071486-retrieve-data-using-sql) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) offer intro to SQL courses
